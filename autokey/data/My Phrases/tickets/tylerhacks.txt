This is Sean with Support, thank you for your patience as the scan was completed. Unfortunately, the scan did identify some malware/malicious code. The hacked files that were identified in the scan are as follows:

** Insert Log Path or Results (depending on size) **> You can view the report at this file location or see the attachment to this message.

If you'd like, we can quarantine those files for you, however, we are unaware of how the site will function without those files being accessible. Please let us know if you'd like to pursue that option. Although, if you have a known, clean cPanel backup, then you can upload that to the server and then we will be able to assist you with restoring that backup.

Since you have a VPS/Dedicated Server we can also install ImunifyAV which is a free scanning tool for WHM. Here is a link for additional information on Imunify, https://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/product-guides/vps-hosting/getting-started-with-imunifyav-cpanel-plugin/.

Most frequently, hacks the result of out-of-date software installations; any outdated installation on the account can result in hacks on any site on the account. Please note that while upgrading the outdated software is recommended and may close existing vulnerabilities, it will not remove any hacks that have already been injected into the site. Therefore, you should have a developer or someone familiar with the website review the account thoroughly.

We recommend reviewing this with your developer or a security specialist. This link to our Learning Center articles may also assist you:
