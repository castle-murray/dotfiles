This is Sean with Support, thank you for your patience as our scan completed. The scan for malicious PHP shells using our internal tool has finished and did not identify any potentially malicious files. Keep in mind that no scanning software is 100% accurate. You will want to follow this support article we have on this topic if you ever believe there is a hack that occurred: http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/hacks/recovering-from-a-hack.

If you still suspect a website compromise that may evade our server side scan, you may want to work with a security developer or firm. We recommend Sucuri for assistance with this; https://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/security/what-is-sucuri/.

Keep in mind that we are available 24/7, do not hesitate to reach out to us in case you have any additional questions or issues; we are more than happy to help. Also, you may get an email later asking how we did today. Feel free to leave any comments on our interaction today there.
